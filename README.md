# VivaPinata_010Editor_Templates
A collection of 010 Templates for Viva Pinata to better read the in-house asset formats

# How to install
 - Make sure you download a new copy of 010EditorWin64Portable, if you dont use the portable version its possible this repo could override your other templates on your main copy, use with caution
 - Clone the templates to "010EditorWin64Portable\010 Templates" and not "010EditorWin64Portable\010 Templates\VivaPinata_010Editor_Templates"

# Optional auto-run templates setup
 - In 010 goto the templates dropdown at the top and click view installed templates
 - Now at the bottom right of the window there is a button called "Import List...", import VivaPinataTemplateList.1tl
 - This will add all of the available automatic templates, this is based on file name so you will need to keep the tag as the name aka "aid_reqspinata_pinata_awards_..." however you can add prefixs and suffixes to the name without issue
